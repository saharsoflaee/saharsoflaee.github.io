It is often understood as a force that explains why people or animals initiate, continue, or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time. It is a complex phenomenon and its precise definition is disputed. It contrasts with amotivation, which is a state of apathy or listlessness. Motivation is studied in fields like psychology, motivation science, and philosophy.</p>\n<p>Motivational states are characterized by their direction, intensity, and persistence. The direction of a motivational state is shaped by the goal it aims to achieve. Intensity is the strength of the state and affects whether the state is translated into action and how much effort is employed. Persistence refers to how long an individual is willing to engage in an activity. Motivation is often divided into two phases: in the first phase, the individual establishes a goal, while in the second phase, they attempt to reach this goal.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 21, 2024","slug":"/what-is-motivation","title":"Motivation","category":"motivation","author":"Sahar Soflaee","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3b50c831e29e1fef6bcaabb873f168bc/b332f/Motivation.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3b50c831e29e1fef6bcaabb873f168bc/7bc75/Motivation.jpg 25w,\n/static/3b50c831e29e1fef6bcaabb873f168bc/78a56/Motivation.jpg 50w,\n/static/3b50c831e29e1fef6bcaabb873f168bc/b332f/Motivation.jpg 100w,\n/static/3b50c831e29e1fef6bcaabb873f168bc/d9f52/Motivation.jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 100px) 100px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3b50c831e29e1fef6bcaabb873f168bc/a4064/Motivation.webp 25w,\n/static/3b50c831e29e1fef6bcaabb873f168bc/6ccb3/Motivation.webp 50w,\n/static/3b50c831e29e1fef6bcaabb873f168bc/88d32/Motivation.webp 100w,\n/static/3b50c831e29e1fef6bcaabb873f168bc/b9488/Motivation.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 100px) 100px, 100vw"}]},"width":100,"height":67}}}},"fields":{"readingTime":{"minutes":0.795}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d2b56e3e-f72f-5968-a8c9-3a4090bdff0e","frontmatter__category":"motivation","frontmatter__slug":"/what-is-motivation","__params":{"frontmatter__category":"motivation","frontmatter__slug":"what-is-motivation"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
