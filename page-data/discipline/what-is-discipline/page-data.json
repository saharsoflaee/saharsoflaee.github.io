Disciplinarians believe that such self-control is of the utmost importance and enforce a set of rules that aim to develop such behavior. Such enforcement is sometimes based on punishment, although there is a clear difference between the two. One way to convey such differences is through the root meaning of each word: discipline means “to teach”, while punishment means “to correct or cause pain”. While punishment might extinguish unwanted behavior in the moment, it is rarely effective long-term, while discipline usually is.</p>\n<h2>Time management</h2>\n<p>Disciplined time management includes removing distractions—the author of No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs recommends treating time as a precious resource. Achieving positive outcomes hinges on a supportive environment of disciplined behavior that requires and rewards good actions.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 20, 2024","slug":"/what-is-discipline","title":"Discipline","category":"discipline","author":"Sahar Soflaee","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f2f2448672d9ccca71e93f0747d9af52/95cfc/discipline.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f2f2448672d9ccca71e93f0747d9af52/7bc75/discipline.jpg 25w,\n/static/f2f2448672d9ccca71e93f0747d9af52/79d2f/discipline.jpg 50w,\n/static/f2f2448672d9ccca71e93f0747d9af52/95cfc/discipline.jpg 100w,\n/static/f2f2448672d9ccca71e93f0747d9af52/e639b/discipline.jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 100px) 100px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f2f2448672d9ccca71e93f0747d9af52/a4064/discipline.webp 25w,\n/static/f2f2448672d9ccca71e93f0747d9af52/56651/discipline.webp 50w,\n/static/f2f2448672d9ccca71e93f0747d9af52/14fbb/discipline.webp 100w,\n/static/f2f2448672d9ccca71e93f0747d9af52/d61ff/discipline.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 100px) 100px, 100vw"}]},"width":100,"height":68}}}},"fields":{"readingTime":{"minutes":0.745}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a7652757-cb96-5b21-a8e0-6bdefc5b8567","frontmatter__category":"discipline","frontmatter__slug":"/what-is-discipline","__params":{"frontmatter__category":"discipline","frontmatter__slug":"what-is-discipline"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
